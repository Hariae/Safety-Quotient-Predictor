## Project idea 1:  
## Title: **DISASTER RELIEF MANAGEMENT**  
## Abstract: 
          Disaster management and recovery have been a challenge for humans for a long time. With advanced and powerful machinery the situation has improved in the last few decades. There is a gap in communication during critical disaster period, between disaster management team and the victims. In such situations, time plays a crucial role and timely action and appropriate distribution of resources can reduce damage to life and property to a greater extent.
Our vision is to improve the disaster recovery and management process in a better way with the aid of Machine Learning. The focus is on managing relief materials to reach the disaster critical zone in an optimum amount based on the concentration of the affected area. We assess the critical zone and evaluate the distribution of resources among the affected regions. The system is targeted towards the people involved in disaster management teams.

## Project Idea 2:  
## TITLE: **DOCTOR RUN**  
## Abstract: 
            Providing medical assistance for the fitness application users is the need of the hour. With millions of people using fitness gadgets to track their running, many are not able to self-assess whether continuing running with their current medical condition, or the distance they have covered for their age and weight is appropriate or not. What if we could prompt runners to walk or run more/less based on their weight and age, and provide them the details of how much that person with that weight and age must run to be fit?
The motive includes collecting the basic medical history of the user, and by further collecting heartbeats per minute details, we could measure the fitness level of the user and we would prompt them with appropriate medical assistance or advise them to consult the doctor before he/she runs further. This would drastically avoid catastrophes faced by runners under medical conditions, who are running without knowing the repercussions of pursuing fitness with their impediments.

## Project Idea 3:  
## TITLE: **PREDICT NEIGHBOURHOOD SAFETY QUOTIENT**  
## Abstract: 
            People keep relocating to new places due to change of jobs, schools, or other reasons. Safety has been one of the crucial factor involved in deciding to live in a locality. In the recent past, there has been an upsurge in crimes in the bay area. It is often difficult for people to consider the safety of the location due to unavailability of tools to evaluate the trend of crimes and predict if the safety of the place would be favorable during their stay for x number of years in the area. Most of the tools available in the market show recent data, which would be dynamic based on the trends and hence cannot be utilized effectively to predict how the crime rates will look in the next x number of years. Thus, there is a need for an application which would predict the safety value of the locality based on the past history of crimes in and surrounding the location. The application will facilitate the renters and home buyers to make better decision to relocate to the area.
